# BIN PACKING PROBLEM

- Bin packing problem is about how to fit several items into bins(containers) in an efficient way
- **NP-complete** problem
- items of different **w<sub>i</sub>** volumes must be packed into a finite **N** numbers of bins(containers) - each of these into a finite **N**
- minimize the numbers of bins used
